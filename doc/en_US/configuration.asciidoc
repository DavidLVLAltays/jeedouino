=== The plugin configuration

On the configuration page of the plugin

image::../images/ConfOptions.png[]

==== Tab: Options
* You can activate logs (attention very verbose).
[IMPORTANT]
It is not recommended to leave this box checked constantly because this option generates a lot of writing in the log files.
[NOTE]
You must also activate "Debug" level logs in Jeedom (Menu Configuration-> Configuration of log & messages).

* It is possible to activate the virtual groups (automatic creation of orders in virtual to simplify your equipment / facilities).
[NOTE]
This option only appears if you have the Virtual plugin installed and enabled in your Jeedom.

* It is possible to activate the pin user (automatic creation of orders for your personal Arduinos/IOPS skits).
[NOTE]
This option only appears if you have the expert mode enabled in your Jeedom.

==== Tab: Dependencies

image::../images/configuration0.png[]

A link is available to go download the latest Arduino IDE to flash the skits on your boards.

* https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

[IMPORTANT]
Pour l'instant, les sketchs ne sont compatibles qu'avec l'ide de Arduino.cc (v1.6.7 recommandée).

* For ESP8266 cards NodeMCU, Wemos you can also use the Arduino IDE by adding the ESP8266 support.

** http://esp8266.github.io/Arduino/versions/2.0.0-rc2/doc/installing.html

For GPIO of the RPI, one button is available for the installation of dependencies.

* http://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/install/ 

Similarly, a button is provided for those of PiFace cards.

* https://github.com/piface/pifacedigitalio

* It will also require to enable SPI module.

** http://piface.github.io/pifacecommon/installation.html#enable-the-spi-module
** http://www.piface.org.uk/guides/Install_PiFace_Software/Enabling_SPI/	

Same, a button is present for those of AB Electronics UK Pi More IO cards.

* https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/ABElectronics_Python_Libraries/tree/master/IOPi

* It will also require to enable the I2C module.

[IMPORTANT]
It is not necessary to install the dependencies on all your Jeedom, only those that will be used.

[TIP]
Two shortcuts are present to jump view the logs of the plugin, and to go to your equipment (only on master)

==== Tab: Daemons

_ Example of different possible demons:_

image::../images/configuration1.png[]

Here, as soon as you create equipment requiring the use of demons, they will appear.

They will be displayed with a direct shortcut to the equipment, their host Jeedom, operating status and the ability to restart or shutdown the daemon.
[TIP]
Regarding the Arduino USB connected equipment, an additional link to download the sketch will be present.
It will therefore need to be uploaded in the corresponding Arduino.

[IMPORTANT]
Following a reboot / restart the host system, daemons are launched only about 4 minutes after starting Jeedom.

[NOTE]
An option to check every 5 minutes, the proper functioning of daemons and restart them at least is now available.

==== Tab: Sketches for your network equipment (Arduino and ESP8266 / NodeMCU / Wemos)

The Arduinos / ESP / NodeMCU / network Wemos not needing daemons, here come the sketches for them.
Only those of the created equipment.

[IMPORTANT]
Pour l'instant, les sketchs ne sont compatibles qu'avec l'ide de Arduino.cc (v1.6.7 recommandée).

==== Tab: Configuration Docker 

If your Jeedom is on Docker, activate the option, and enter the host IP (The NAS usually) and the mapped port (often 9080).
